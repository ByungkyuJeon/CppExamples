# CppExamples

cpp code examples about language specification with some comments of explanation.

## Motivation

this small personal project of cpp example codes is for myself to understand cpp programming language deeply. the codes contains advanced parts of cpp language specific components and my explanations of that.

cpp programming language allows vast control to programmer compared to some other languages. There are lots of  operations we can write and also lots of things to know. when knowing deeper and deeper, cpp will be super powerful and fast. 

so I studied them and thought they needed to be listed up clearly.
